User stories
    “As someone who forgets a lot, I want to add items to my todo list because I don’t want to forget.”	
        Set a button to add to-do items
    
    “As someone who wants to manage to-do items, each to-do item should be able to be snoozed and completed because it will make it easier for me to adjust my to-do list.”
        Each to-do item can be adjusted by the user to a postponed date or completed status.
    
    As someone who often forgets, I want to know how often each to-do item is created and completed. 
        Set a timeline for each to-do item, including creation time, postponement time, and completion time.
    
    “As someone who has a lot of items on my todo list, I want to be reminded when an item needs to be done because I don’t want to get the order mixed up.”
        Each to-do item can be reminded based on the time remaining.
    
    “As someone who does not have a lot of storage on my device, I want my todo list to be saved with the cloud because I want to be able to access it anywhere without it taking up space on my storage.”
        Upload to-dos to the cloud.
        Set up a sync button to get to-do items from the cloud and sync to your device.
        When the device is offline, work locally on the device.
        When I cannot connect to the network, I will be prompted.
    
    "As a user who wants to know their to-do list intuitively, I hope the software can show me my to-do list intuitively and clearly."
        The app will have a statistics dashboard that shows the following statistics in one single piechart: number of all todo items, number of completed todo items, number of overdue todo items and number of pending todo items.
